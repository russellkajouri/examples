A range of simulations of Carbon dioxide molecules of TraPPE force field with a shifted and cut off VdW potential at 12 AA, while the long range electrostatic potential was treated via PPPM method of accuracy 1.0e-4.
The numebr of CO2 molecules were kept 500 for all simulations and the simulation box's size was modified, the temperature is 300 K.
